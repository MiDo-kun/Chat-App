# Chat App

The Chat App is a real-time chat application that allows users to send messages using AJAX and PHP for an asynchronous request-response cycle. This provides an interactive and engaging user experience when using the application. The application also features a login and sign-up page that allows users to create an account and use it as their profile when using the application.

The Chat App is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and PHP, with MySQL as the database. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a clean and modern interface.

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Gain a better understanding of how sessions work in PHP.
- Learn how to handle user authentication by implementing login and sign-up page.
- Understand the importance of asynchronous request-response cycle in web applications.
- Improve web design by using core web technologies such as HTML and CSS.

## Key Features

The Chat App offers the following key features:

- **Login and Sign-up Page**: The login and sign-up page allows users to create an account and use it as their profile when using the application. Users can log in using their email and password, or sign up for a new account if they don't have one yet.

- **Active and Inactive User Display**: The Chat App displays a list of active and inactive users, making it easy for users to see who is online and available to chat.

- **Real-time Messaging**: The Chat App allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, providing an interactive and engaging user experience. The application uses AJAX and PHP for an asynchronous request-response cycle, allowing messages to be sent and received without the need for page refreshes.

- **User Profile**: The Chat App allows users to create a profile that they can use when using the application.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- How to use sessions in PHP.
- How authentication works and how to validate user credentials in PHP.
- Improve my understanding on how AJAX works in the application.
- How to reuse php components in the application.
- Improve web design skills by using CSS.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using AJAX, PHP and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
